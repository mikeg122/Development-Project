  <h1>Welcome to Common Techniques and Mitigations</h1>
  <p>On average, Social Engineering attacks has been reported to cost over £99,000 per attack.</p>
  <p>The financial and societal impact this has cannot be understated.</p>
  <p>Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions.</p>
  <p>It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.</p>
  <h2>What are the most common forms of Social Engineering?</h2>
  <p>The below section will show the 5 most common Social Engineering techniques and <b>some, not all of the mitigations that could be used to prevent these attacks from happening to you.</b></p>
</div>

<div class="phishing_content"> 
  <h2>Phishing Techniques</h2>
  <p>As one of the most popular social engineering attack types, phishing scams are <b>email and text message campaigns aimed at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims. It then prods them into revealing sensitive information, clicking on links to malicious websites, or opening attachments that contain malware.</b><p>An example is an email sent to users of an online service that alerts them of a policy violation requiring immediate action on their part, such as a required password change. </p> <p> It includes a link to an illegitimate website—nearly identical in appearance to its legitimate version—prompting the unsuspecting user to enter their current credentials and new password. Upon form submittal the information is sent to the attacker.</p>
  <p><b>An example of how a traditional phishing attack would work can be seen below.</b></p>

<div class="phishing_mitigations"> 
  <h2>Phishing Mitigations</h2>
  <h3>Firewalls</h3>
  <p>There are many ways to mitigate phishing attacks. One of the best way is firewalls. These act as a digital defence mechanism, and prevent unauthorised users from being able to access.</p>
  <h3>MFA</h3>
  <p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be used, and improved password solutions should be considered. MFA protects information from being hacked and can go a long way. In addition to a username and password, it uses a secondary verification method, such as a one-time password sent through SMS, a physical token, or a biometric ID.</p>

<div class="baiting_content"> 
  <h2>Baiting Techniques</h2>
  <p><b>Baiting attacks, as the name implies, use a false promise to spark a victim's curiosity. They trick consumers into falling into a trap in which their personal information is stolen or their computers are infected with malware. Baiting is similar to phishing in many respects. Baiting however, is a way of enticing the victim with the promise of an item or good.</b></p>
  <p>Physical media is used to disseminate malware in the most hated form of baiting. For example, attackers may place the bait—usually malware-infected flash drives—in settings where potential victims are likely to encounter it (e.g., bathrooms, elevators, the parking lot of a targeted company). The bait has a genuine appearance, with a label identifying it as the company's payroll list.</p>
  <p>Victims pick up the bait out of curiosity and place it in a work or home computer, causing malware to be installed automatically.</p>

<div class="baiting_mitigations"> 
  <h2>Baiting Mitigations</h2>
  <h3>Be aware</h3>
  <p>Ensure that you are wary of any too-good-to-be-true proposition; if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
  <p>Encourage others to ask (if in doubt) before disclosing any personal information by creating an open and safe atmosphere for questioning.</p>
  <p>Ensure that you have anti-virus and anti-malware software installed on your PC.</p>
  <p>Set up suitable network security procedures to prevent incidents from occurring.</p>
  <p>Real life simulations can also be a good idea, placing a few non-malcious USB devices in easy to find areas to see if friends or family put them in their laptop or desktop.</p>
  <p>The best practice is to hover your mouse over the link to see where it might take you.</p>

<div class="tailgating_content"> 
  <h2>Tailgating Techniques</h2>
  <p><b>Someone without the right authorization follows an authenticated employee into a restricted area in these types of attacks. For example, the attacker could pose as a delivery driver and wait outside a building. </b></p>
  <p>When an employee obtains security approval and unlocks the entrance, the attacker asks the employee to hold the door open, allowing the attacker to gain access to the building.</p>
  <p>In the presence of certain security measures, such as a keycard system, tailgating is not possible. Attackers can strike up discussions with staff and utilise this display of familiarity to sneak past the front desk in firms that lack these features.</p>
  <p><b>An real world example of how a traditional tailgating attack would work can be seen below.</b></p>
</div>

<div class="tailgating_mitigations"> 
  <h2>Tailgating Mitigations</h2>
  <h3>Access Control</h3>
  <p>Installing adequate access control systems and managing them methodically is one of the most efficient ways of decreasing tailgating risks - turnstiles are a good example of such a solution.</p>
  <p>Turnstiles are the preferred access control mechanism for busy facilities since they allow only one person through at a time.</p>
  <h3>Video Surveillance</h3>
  <p>Video Surveillance can also be good when monitoring family or friends going in or out of your home. You can also find this type of technology in workplaces, or in high value insitutions such as banks.</p>

<div class="pretexting_content"> 
  <h2>Pretexting Techniques</h2>
  <p><b>Pretexting is a type of social engineering in which the attacker creates a pretext, or a made-up scenario, in order to obtain someone's personal information. In these types of assaults, the scammer frequently poses as a well-known entity or individual and claims that they require specific information from the victim in order to validate their identity.  </b></p>
  <p>If the victim agrees, the attackers will steal the victim's identity or use the information for other harmful purposes.</p>
  <p>Pretexting that is more complex entails duping victims into doing anything that violates the organization's security regulations. For example, an attacker might pose as an external IT services auditor in order to get access to the building's physical security team.</p>
  <p>Unlike phishing, which takes use of anxiety and urgency, pretexting relies on creating a false sense of urgency.</p>

<div class="pretexting_mitigations"> 
  <h2>Pretexting Mitigations</h2>
  <h3>User Awareness</h3>
  <p>This may seem self explanatory, but simply being self-aware at all times will greatly prevent attacks from occuring. Firstly, check the scenario that the potential attacker has sent to you.Does it seem legitimate? Do you recognise the name of the person who is claiming to contact you?</p>
  <p>Remaining calm and asking yourself these simple questions can be extremely useful in preventing a pretexting attack.</p>
  <h3>Think before you act</h3>
  <p>When someone who has contacted you begins asking for personal information, you should be especially cautious. Remember that your bank already has all of the information it needs about you and shouldn't require you to provide your account number. 
  <p>Hang up and call their publicly available phone number or write to an email address from their website if you're sceptical about a talk with an institution.</p>

<div class="scareware_content"> 
  <h2>Scareware Techniques</h2>
  <p><b>The victims of scareware are assaulted with false alerts and bogus threats. Users are duped into believing their system is infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has no purpose (other than to benefit the offender) or is malware.</b></p>
  <p>Deception software, rogue scanning software, and fraudware are all terms used to describe scareware.</p>
  <p>The legitimate-looking popup banners that appear in your browser while you're browsing the web, displaying phrases like "Your computer may be infected with nasty spyware applications," are a popular scareware example. </p>
  <p>It either offers to install the utility for you (which is frequently malware-infested) or directs you to a malicious website where your PC is infected.</p>
  <p>The key elements that make this attack method succesful, is the traditional large writing, red font and flashing element on the screen that causes worry and is intended to make the user act quickly, without logical thought.</p>
  <p><b>An example of traditional scareware can be seen below.</b></p>

<div class="scareware_mitigations"> 
  <h2>Scareware Mitigations</h2>
  <h3>Avoid clicking on suspicious pop-up ads</h3>
  <p>Especially those that claim to know alot about your devices problems, or those that offer a free diagnostic scan. Any tool that demands immediate payment should also be avoided and reported where possible.</p>
  <h3>Keep browser updated</h3>
  <p>Maintain the most recent version of your browser(s) with all security patches installed. This will reduce the chance of attackers exploiting the current exploits of the browser you are using as a doorway of access.</p>
  <h3>Download/update anti-virus software</h3>
  <p>Install antivirus software such as Avast from a respected vendor or utilise the built-in option in your operating system.</p>
  <p>Ad blockers are also useful. This stops the problem at source by preventing the majority of ads from displaying within your browser.</p>
