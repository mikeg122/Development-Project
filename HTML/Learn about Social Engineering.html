  <h1>Welcome to Learn about Social Engineering</h1>
  <p>The below learning area is a brief introduction to Social Engineering</p>
  <p>On average, Social Engineering attacks has been reported to cost over £99,000 per attack.</p>
  <p>The financial and societal impact this has cannot be understated.</p>
  <p>Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions.</p>
  <p>It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.</p>

  <h2>How does Social Engineering work? </h2>
  <p>Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather necessary background information, such as potential points of entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the attack.   
  <p>Then, the attacker looks to gain the victims trust and provide enablement for subsequent actions that break security practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.</p>
  <p>The below image shows a commonly used process regarding the Social Engineering attack lifecycle. </p>

<p>What makes social engineering especially dangerous is that it relies on human error, rather than vulnerabilities in software and operating systems.</p> 
<p>Mistakes made by legitimate users are much less predictable, making them harder to identify and thwart than a malware-based intrusion.</p>
